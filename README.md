# EnvAIoT

The **Env**ironment for modeling and simulating **A**daptive **I**nternet **o**f **T**hings applications is a tool that may assist IoT system designers, engineers, architects, and developers in the design phase of an IoT system, focusing on the system's self-adaptation features and providing an approach to model and validate if their adaptation strategies are effective in the presence of known and unknown uncertain contexts. 

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Postman (Non-Mandatory)
- Internet access

### Running EnvAIoT

1. After cloning this project, let's first prepare the environment.<br>
    1.1 Creating a virtual environment <br>
    *On Windows:*
    ```
    python -m venv env
    ```

    *On Linux distributions:*
    ```
    virtualenv env
    ```
    <br>

    1.2 Activating the virtual environment. <br>
    *On Windows:*
    ```
    cd env
    Scripts\activate
    cd ..
    ```

    *On Linux distributions:*
    ```
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

    <br>
    1.3 Installing the dependencies: <br>
    
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Running the application <br>
    *On Windows:*
    ```
    python application.py
    ```

    *On Linux distributions:*
    ```
    python3 application.py
    ```

Now, EnvAIoT is ready to receive and model an IoT application. In the following, let's run the pre-ready three examples we have by running the scripts.
